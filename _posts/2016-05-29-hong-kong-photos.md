Hong Kong, is intriguing. Should I call it as country, or is it part of China? Was I in Hong Kong or in China? The politically correct answer would be: both.

Hong Kong is a Chinese territory, but Beijing gave them a very high degree of autonomy. They're very different to each other, yet they're very similar.

Hong Kong is full of contradiction.

Tall and modern building everywhere, yet large part of Hong Kong is unspoiled nature. With shopping mall could be seen at every block in the city center, Hong Kong still has a lot of shady, hole in the wall shops. And also: the Hongkongese don't think they're the same with the Mainlanders. The contradiction goes on.

The first thing that made me surprised was how the Hongkongese speak English: they speak with British accent. For me, when I first heard it, it sure sounded out of place. But thinking about it further, it all makes sense, Hong Kong was a British colony.

After the Opium War that ravaged the Qing, Hong Kong became a British colony for more than one hundred years. Hence, it's a no wonder that there are a lot of British influences there.

Hong Kong excels on the unexpected from a country with the reputation of high profile frantic shopping: natural wonder. Hong Kong islands are mountainous and still have a lot of green color on them.

In fact, there are 8 sections of hiking trail across Hong Kong. Combined together, it's a 50 km trail.

Undisputedly, the main highlight of those sections is the section 8. It's where the Dragon's Back trail is.

One could see where that name comes from when hiking the Hong Kong Trail section 8. On top of the mountains, the path looks like a spine that goes wavy following the contour of the top of the mountains.

According to Euromonitor International, Hong Kong was the most visited city in the world with 27 million of tourist in 2012. To give some perspective, at the second place, London, was visited by only 17 million of tourist in the same year.

Hong Kong is definitely a great place that would cater every traveler's purpose. Whether it's for shopping or for the nature, Hong Kong has it all.
