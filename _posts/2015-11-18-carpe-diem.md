<blockquote>First I was dying to finish high school and start college
And then I was dying to finish college and start working
And then I was dying to marry and have children
And then I was dying for my children to grow old enough for school so I could return to work
And then I was dying to retire
And now, I am dying… and suddenly I realize I forgot to live
</blockquote>

So what’s the similarity of this post’s title and that quote? It tells us to live and enjoy the present.

That’s the quote I always remember. It’s a tempus fugit indeed, that I first encountered that quote exactly a year ago. It hit home really hard at me that moment, it still does. It gives me the strength and resolve to force me to live at the present to its fullest.

Whenever I’ve made a decision for the future, I always look forward eagerly for it. Sometimes, life at the present would be very unenjoyable. My sight will always be at that distant future, with all the glories that radiate to the present time. Granted, my life will often be miserable because of it.

Once, Dalai Lama was asked what surprises him the most. His reply was:

<blockquote>“Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”</blockquote>

Hence, I always try to force myself to live at the present. Sure, it's not always works. I failed an awful lot of times. But I always try. Similar to exercise. Doesn’t matter how slow you run, swim, or cycle, you’ll always be faster than the one that’s not doing it. Doesn’t matter how short the distance you covered, you’ll always cover more distance than the one that’s not doing it.

Also, another quote from Oscar Wilde:

<blockquote>"To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all."</blockquote>

To be exist is a very easy thing to do. Just follow the society. Do the usual things to make the society happy.

To just merely exist is what I fear the most. Life is too short, it’s shorter than a blink of an eye of the universe, awfully short to not to live.
