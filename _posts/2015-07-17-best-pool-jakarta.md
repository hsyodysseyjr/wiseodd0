It's funny. Well, I guess it's true that the good things only happen at the end. Just when I start counting the day until I leave this city (Jakarta) for good, I found what I think is the best swimming pool in Jakarta.  Mind you, this comes from my small sample size, because obviously I haven't tried every single goddamn pool in Jakarta. But for me, the quality is really good.

One of my favorite activity is swimming. I used to routinely swam for three times a week. But nowadays, it's really bothersome because of the lack of transportation here in Jakarta, hence I swim just once a week now. I already seen my bright swimming future in Yogyakarta when I come there next month, simply because it's a small city, and I have my own personal transportation. Yay!

I used to swim in what should be the best swimming pool in Jakarta, heck, even Indonesia, because it's the main national stadium in Indonesia: Gelora Bung Karno. But if you think the quality is really really good, then you obviously don't know the Indonesian government. They do the job poorly on maintaining the pool, so the quality is just plain bad, especially the water quality and shower room. But it does the purpose though, it's a swimming pool, and people are able to swim there.

Recently I tried to search for the better alternatives, and tried Pertamina's swimming pool in location named Simprug. It's not very far from Gelora Bung Karno, but, well, it's not Jakarta if the path is not intertwined. It looks a lot farther than if you just draw a straight line between them.

I'm really impressed by the pool. It's not crowded (it was Ramadan though, which naturally a lot of people don't swim that time), it's clean, has good showers, and the most important thing is that the pool is a very clean and olympic sized. I fell in love at the first sight .

The ticket price to enter this pool is comparable with that in Gelora Bung Karno, Rp 20.000. But, with better infrastructure and better pool overall, it's well worth more than Gelora Bung Karno.

You could also do SCUBA training session here, because there has 25mx25m swimming pool for fancy diving. I believe it's 5m or 7m deep, but I'm not sure as I haven't tried it.

The only downside of this swimming pool is that it's really hard to get there if you don't have your own car/motorcycle. There is a TransJakarta route passing this area, but the transit point is very far and scarce, which means that if you don't live near that line of TransJakarta, then you have to travel farther. So your best bet is to just hire a cab or hire one of those motorcycle cabs.

When I'm in Yogyakarta, I hope I could find a swimming pool as good as this. My criteria is simple: olympic sized, clean water, adequate shower, and not very crowded.
