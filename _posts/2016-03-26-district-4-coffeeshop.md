I've been living here in District 4 of Ho Chi Minh City for almost two weeks now. But, not until recently that I found a very great place to work. Sure, it's a western coffee chain, but it sure does check all of my requirements about an ideal workplace.

That place is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in Nguyen Tat Thanh Street, District 4, Ho Chi Minh City. It's here:

So, why is it a great place to work?

First and foremost, comfortable desks and seats. The ergonomic is just right to work with, whether it's with a laptop or pencil and paper. I don't really need a fancy, cushioned, big director chair to get my job done. But one thing that is essential to me is the table's relative height compared to the chair's height; it has to be just right. This place nails it.

Also, if you notice from the picture above, there was barely anyone there. There were some people there who were also working with their laptops for hours, I might as well mistook that place as a coworking space. Mind you, I took that picture at around the lunch time. I was also there from the morning until the afternoon, and still, it was so empty. Maybe because it's located in District 4, where there was barely anything going on? Anyway, that's a really good plus for me as it leads to less noise, less competition for internet bandwidth, and fewer distraction.

No shortage of power plugs will ever occur there, as there are so many power plugs near almost every desk. It's a godsend to me as it means that I don't need to be under the mercy of my laptop battery while working there.

About the internet speed. As there are barely anyone there, it was really fast. I got around 20 mbps up and down, which was amazing for a coffee shop, as usually I don't really have high expectation about coffee shop's internet speed. So far, this was the fastest internet I've ever found in a coffee shop.


I've tried to work in Highlands Coffee (Vietnamese Starbucks) and another branch of Coffee Bean in Bitexco Tower, but so far, this one is the best. Highlands Coffee sure give you good drinks for way cheaper prices, but the internet speed is not really great. Bitexco's Coffee Bean don't have the same ergonomic power and quietness as Nguyen Tat Thanh branch. At noon, it would be really crowded. And lastly, I won't even bother with Starbucks even though they've got them here in HCMC.

If I could point a flaw, which is not really a flaw, it would be the price. Because it's a western coffee chain, the price is steep compared to local coffee shops. I think the price is about the same as Starbucks. However, for what I get by buying one drink here is totally worth the price. Basically you get a perfect workplace for the day by just buying one drink.
