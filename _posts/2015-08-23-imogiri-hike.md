Imogiri, best known for Mataram Sultanate's Royal Tombs, turns out has a lot to offer for hikers. Eastern Imogiri is a hilly, mountainous area. And there, where a lot of great lookouts reside.

Yesterday, I went to three absolutely amazing places in Imogiri: Kebun Buah Mangunan, pine forest, and Becici Peak. As for the trail, it was OK if not disappointing. You see, the ideal trail for me to hike is something like 2-4 hours round trip trail. These trails in Imogiri though... they're only like 30 minutes hike top, which left me wanting for more.

However, the summits and the lookouts beyond the trails are amazing. The air was clear. The temperature was perfect. The scenery was amazing. I even spotted an eagle flew overhead, over the valley (just like that one OSX wallpaper!).

This is the "Kebun Buah Mangunan"'s peak. It's overlooked the Oyo river valley. It's absolutely gorgeous. Zooming in, one could see a suspension bridge, crossing the Oyo.

You could drive through the orchard, up until just before the peak. But, where's the fun in that? So, I hiked from the enterance instead. The trail was not long. It's only about 0.5-1 km, with some serious climb. I guess so few people use the trail to the point they made a road access to the summit.

The second place, is the pine forest, some 2-3km from Mangunan Orchard. It was a great forest, but without a hiking trail. A lot of casual people picnicing here. So it's a meh for me.

However, up at the hill from the forest, there is an lookout, attached to a big tree. It has two platforms. The first one is about 5 meters from the ground, and the second one is 10 meters from the ground. At the top of the lookout, the scenery is amazing. Although the wind blew harder there. I think I've proven that "the higher the tree, the harder the wind blows" theorem. So Q.E.D, I guess?

Next destination is the pine forest peak, Becici. I don't know who gave that name, but I guess it was the first name that crossed the namer's mind. Whatever. 

Becici is around 1-2 km from the pine forest. This place has a hiking trail. But, just like Mangunan Orchard, it's short. Only took me 5-10 minutes to the top.

Whereas Mangunan and the pine forest lookouts are overlooking the south of the hills, Becici's peak is right at the northern edge. So, from here, one can actually observe the Yogyakarta city from the south. In a clear day, one could also observe Merapi and Merbabu. Such a pity though, it was overcast when I got there.

So at the picture above, if there's no cloud, you will see Merapi and Merbabu at the background.

There are also some cliche platform, used by teenagers to take photos. There is no safety mechanism in the platforms, so any shenanigan could proven to be fatal.

As a remark, I found that Imogiri offers a lot of great sceneries. Although the trails are somewhat underwhelming, the vistas alone are worth it.

For next week's hike, I'm thinking of Kosakora Peak, in Drini beach, south-eastern Gunung Kidul, some 65km from my home. I hope not only the scenery, but also the trail is good there. 

Afterall, the most important thing in one's life is the process, not merely just the result. You could take a shortcut, hurt the competitors, and cheats. And you will still get the result. But does it feel fullfilling?
