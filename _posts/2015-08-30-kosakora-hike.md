Kosakora, also previously known as Segara Ngrumput by the locals, is a hill, located around 1km from Drini Beach. From central Yogyakarta, it's around 70km. One could take a route going to Wonosari, then go all the way south from there, or from Imogiri, go all the way east through Panggang, and go a little bit south. Either way, they would all converge at one point: Baron beach. Once in Baron beach area, it's just a matter of going east for around 2km to get to Drini beach.

Gunung Kidul is famous for its shoreline. So many beaches can be found there. There are more than 20 of them, I think. Most of them are great, but some of the old beaches are too popular, overused, and lack of maintenance and not really great anymore. Baron is the great example of this. However, a lot of newfound beaches are really good, like Drini.

Drini is also the start of Kosakora trail. From the beach, just go uphill to start the trail. The first part of the trail is your typical karst  hill: dry, rocky, and not so lush vegetation.

Right next after the hill, it's the lowland. The trail is not clearly marked, I got lost for more than one time. Thankfully, there are some locals there who were gathering grass.

Right beside this lowland is a beach. It's not a commercialized beach, but rather a small bay with a lot of rocks. It's quite good though.

After one more hill, the trail ended at a medium sized bay with white sand beach. It's the main entry point of the Kosakora hill. You could see the hill from here, right next to the beach.

The last portion of the trail is a hike up to that hill. You'll be asked for IDR 2000 for a hike to the summit. Basically one need to scale the hill's cliff to get to the summit. However, the locals there have installed some stairs and handhold.

And, finally, once you've done with those stairs, you'll be on the Kosakora's summit!

From here, you could see the trail that brought you here. If you squint, you could see Drini beach, the starting point of the trail. The summit was called as Bukit Ngrumput by the locals before it became Kosakora. Bukit is hill, and Ngrumput is grass in Indonesian. It was named so because the hill's summit is like a steppe. It's bald, just grass, not many other vegetation.

The view is really great though. You can see the magnificent Indian Ocean from here. And if you look at west - north western from the summit, the scenery changes drastically: hilly landscape. It's surprising how it changes so drastically. The hills are almost feel like those Chocolate Hills in Philippine.

Now, for the way back to Drini beach, you have two options: backtrack the way you came, or trace the shoreline. For unprepared hiker the later option is a no go. It's rather difficult, where you have to hop up and down the sharp rocks. So, for leisure visitor, you shouldn't do it, because it's rather dangerous. Rocks can cut you by just touching them. So, wear a pair of hiking boots if you want to do it!

Also, it's depend on your time there. I'm fortunate because the tide was low. But I could imagine if the tide is high, you couldn't do it either way, whether you're prepared or not. Even as the tide was low, the wave was crashing the cliff hard.

When you've finished tracing that shoreline, you'll be in the small beach I've mentioned earlier. So it's like a straight path that bypasses the hill inland. You could continue your way back to Drini beach by backtracking the remaining trail.

I really like the trail and the scenery along the trail of Kosakora. By going slowly and stopping a lot to look at the scenery, I managed to finish the trail in around one hour. So it's not a hard trail by any means. Just wear a proper hiking boots when you're doing the trail. You'll thank me later.
