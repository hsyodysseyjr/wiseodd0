Due to a miscalculation, my business in Indonesia became more complicated than it shoul've been, as time concerned. I didn't factor in the possibility of public holiday back then, let alone *very long* holiday. And suddenly I realized it was Easter weekend. Indonesian got 5 days of holiday! Yay for them, not for me.

Every flight was full booked.

Technically, I could extend my stay there in Indonesia, but, one thing I was sure was that I wanted to continue my travel as soon as possible. So, I just grabbed the best option, in term of price: Kota Kinabalu.

Kota Kinabalu, located in the northern shore of Borneo, is the capital city of Sabah state, Malaysia. It's a unique city with Mt. Kinabalu looming large in the south of the city and the blue sea of Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park reflecting the sun in the north. Lo and behold, I found a gem of a city. It's a perfect place for SCUBA diving.

A serendipity indeed, that I originally wanted to go to The Philippines for that very reason. So, the first day I'm here, I checked out many dive shops around the town. I then booked a trip (2 dives) for RM 268 (~ $67), which is a steal if you consider what I've paid and what I've got, SCUBA diving in West Java, Indonesia.

Now, that I haven't dove for *exactly* a year, I did my refresher course first. Then, quickly, we dove up until 18m of depth, as my One Star CMAS certification is translated directly to PADI Open Water.

It was such a great experience. It always is. Everything is calm while so lively. Lots of colors everywhere I see.

I saw many interesting creatures. Razorfishes, Snappers, Nudibranches, egg-laying squids, Pipefish, and also Stingray! Oh, I also found Nemo, the clownfish! I claim that I've made a Disney's title obsolete.

When I dive, I lost track of time. Which, like I always say, is a good way to gauge how passionate I am to something. There is no other way than to try new things, *a lot* of new things, to find which thing(s) I am passionate to. That's why, embracing the possibility is the best way to life for me, it makes my life exciting and lively.

Possibility implies freedom. And with possibility, comes power: the power of choice.
