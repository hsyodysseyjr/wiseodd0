I almost cried. Tears right at the edge of my eyes. It was like a storm, hitting my emotion so hard. This, what a book could do to you, and I almost forgot about it. It was the feeling I haven't felt for a long time.

I didn't like sci-fi genre. It's silly, it's superfluous, it's not enchanting at all. I love Slaugtherhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut. But I hate every chapter that tell me about the inter galaxy experience. That's how much I didn't like sci-fi. However, after reading Flowers for Algernon, I realized, that sci-fi isn't just inter galaxy journey, spaceships, and whatnot. There are humble, down to earth science fictions. Just like Flowers for Algernon. I guess that makes me like sci-fi genre now.

From start to finish, reading Flowers for Algernon is emotional. It made me feel wide range of emotions, culminating at the end of the book. It's like when Titanic hit the iceberg. It struck, hard.

First few page, I felt confused. What the hell is going on, don't the author know how to write? But then it came to light. And soon, I was deeply enchanted with the protagonist. I felt what he felt, it was almost like. I couldn't help but noticed that. The emotion, it was flowing... I couldn't even describe it.

At the end of the book, when things were started going downhill to the anti climax, that was when it's the hardest to take, the emotions.

I remembered when was the last time I cried. It was at high school. No, not because a girl. Not because some dramas. But because a movie. It was Studio Ghibli's Grave of Fireflies. Hey, what's the worst an anime could do to you? I remembered that I lock my door and sobbed quietly, muffled the sound with pillow while watching that. It was so emotional. 

Similar yet not exactly the same kind of emotion went through me with this book. I guess it's not about the type of emotion that matters, but more the magnitude of it. Heck, even if the magnitude is huge, if it doesn't relate to you, I won't do it. Smaller magnitude, but with the right tune and frequency will get to your mind, and resonates. That's when it strikes.

That's all I can say about Flowers of Algernon. Just wondering, how come I missed this book for more than twenty years.

It's wonderful.

I guess I'll read more sci-fis from now on.
